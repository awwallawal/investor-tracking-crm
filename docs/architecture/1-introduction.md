# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the OYSIPA Investor Tracking System & CRM, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

The PRD does not mention a specific starter template or existing project. This is being treated as a "greenfield" project.

*Rationale:* Starting from a clean slate provides the most flexibility to tailor the architecture and technology stack precisely to the project's requirements without being constrained by pre-existing decisions.
