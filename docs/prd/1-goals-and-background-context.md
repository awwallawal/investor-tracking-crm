## Background Context

The Oyo State Investment Promotion Agency (OYSIPA) currently lacks a centralized tool for managing investor relations. Information is fragmented across spreadsheets, documents, and individual knowledge, leading to inefficient operations, a lack of visibility into investor history, and a risk of losing institutional memory. This makes it difficult to track performance and ensure consistent service delivery in line with the agency's framework. This project aims to solve that by creating a single source of truth.
