# 4. Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will be developed within a single repository (monorepo). This will simplify dependency management, streamline the build process, and make it easier for the development team to work across the entire codebase during the initial MVP phase.

## Service Architecture: Monolith

For the MVP, a monolithic service architecture is recommended. This approach, where the entire application is built as a single, unified unit, is the fastest and most straightforward way to develop and deploy the required features within the 4-week timeline. It avoids the overhead and complexity of a microservices architecture, which is not necessary for the initial scope.

## Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

The testing strategy will focus on a combination of Unit and Integration tests. This provides a strong foundation of quality by ensuring individual components work as expected (Unit tests) and that they function correctly when combined (Integration tests). This is a pragmatic approach that balances testing rigor with development velocity for the MVP.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

*   The technology stack should be based on modern, well-supported, and open-source technologies to ensure long-term maintainability and ease of hiring.
*   The final choice of specific languages and frameworks (e.g., for the frontend, backend, and database) is deferred to the Architect, who will make a recommendation based on these requirements.
