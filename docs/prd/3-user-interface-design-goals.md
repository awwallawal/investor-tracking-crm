# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The overall user experience should be one of professional efficiency. The design will be clean, data-focused, and intuitive for internal government staff. The interface will prioritize clarity, ease of data entry, and quick access to information, reinforcing a sense of security and reliability.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

*   **Navigation:** A persistent, role-based navigation bar (e.g., a side menu) will provide access to the main sections of the application.
*   **Data Display:** Data-heavy sections like investor and project lists will be presented in sortable and filterable tables.
*   **Data Entry:** All data creation and editing will occur through clean, well-structured forms with clear validation.
*   **Dashboards:** Dashboards will utilize card-based widgets to present key information at a glance.

## Core Screens and Views

*   **Login Screen:** Secure user authentication.
*   **Main Dashboard:** A role-based landing page (Staff view vs. Director-General view).
*   **Investor Directory:** A searchable and filterable list of all investors.
*   **Investor/Project Detail View:** A comprehensive page showing all information for a single investor or project, including logged interactions.
*   **User Management:** An interface for Portal Administrators to invite and manage staff users.
*   **System Audit Log:** A view for administrators to review the audit trail.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

To ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities, we will target compliance with the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.

## Branding

The application will incorporate the official OYSIPA branding (logo, color palette) if a style guide is provided. If not, a clean, professional, and modern design will be created, suitable for a government agency.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a responsive web app, ensuring a seamless and consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
