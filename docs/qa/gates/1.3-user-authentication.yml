  summary: |
    The implementation correctly fulfills all functional requirements and has a good test suite. 
    However, it deviates from the documented architectural standard by using component-level state (`useState`) 
    instead of the specified Redux Toolkit for frontend state management.

      description: |
        The frontend implementation for the login page uses `useState` for state management, 
        contradicting the architectural decision documented in `docs/architecture.md` which specifies the use of Redux Toolkit.
      recommendation: |
        For this story, the deviation is acceptable as the scope is small. However, the development team must adhere to the Redux Toolkit standard for all subsequent stories involving frontend state management to ensure consistency and maintainability. The PO and Architect should reinforce this standard with the development team.
