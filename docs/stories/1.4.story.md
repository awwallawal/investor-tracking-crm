## Story 1.4: Basic Application Shell & Role-Based Routing

  Status: Pending

  ---

  ### Story

  As an OYSIPA User,
  I want to see the main application layout and a navigation menu that is specific to my role,
  so that I can only access the sections and features I am authorized to use.

  ### Acceptance Criteria

  1.  Once logged in, a consistent application shell (e.g., with a header and side navigation bar) is displayed.
  2.  The navigation menu dynamically displays links based on the user's role (e.g., a `Portal Administrator` sees a "User Management" link, while a `Staff` user does not).
  3.  Users are prevented from accessing unauthorized pages by navigating directly to a URL.

  ### Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Task 1: Frontend - Create Application Shell Component
      - [x] Create a main layout component that includes a header and a persistent sidebar for navigation.
      - [x] The header should display the application name and a "Logout" button.
      - [x] The sidebar will serve as the primary navigation menu.

  - [x] Task 2: Frontend - Implement Role-Based Navigation
      - [x] Create a navigation service or utility that returns a list of navigation links based on the user's role (from the JWT).
      - [x] The sidebar component should use this service to dynamically render the navigation links.
      - [x] Ensure the "User Management" link is only visible to `Portal Administrator` and `Director-General` roles.

  - [x] Task 3: Frontend - Create Protected Route Component
      - [x] Create a higher-order component (HOC) or a wrapper component (e.g., `<ProtectedRoute>`) that checks for a valid JWT.
      - [x] If the user is not authenticated, the `<ProtectedRoute>` should redirect them to the `/login` page.
      - [x] Implement logic within the protected route to also check for required roles if specified for a given route.

  - [x] Task 4: Frontend - Implement Application Routing
      - [x] Use `react-router-dom` to define the application's routes.
      - [x] Wrap the application's main routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/users`) with the `<ProtectedRoute>` component.
      - [x] Create placeholder components for the pages that will be protected (e.g., a simple `<h1>Dashboard</h1>` page).

  ### Dev Notes

  This story establishes the fundamental UI structure and security for the frontend application.

  *   **UI Framework:** [Source: `docs/architecture.md`]
      *   Material-UI (MUI) is the designated component library. The App Shell (AppBar, Drawer for the sidebar, etc.) should be built using MUI components.

  *   **Routing:** [Source: `docs/stories/1.3.story.md`]
      *   `react-router-dom` is already installed and should be used for all client-side routing.

  *   **Role Information:** [Source: `docs/stories/1.3.story.md`]
      *   The user's role is available in the decoded JWT payload. The frontend should have a utility function to decode the token and access this information.

  *   **E2E Testing Deferral:** E2E tests for this story have been deferred due to time constraints. This task should be picked up in a future story or a dedicated testing effort.

  #### Testing

  *   **Component Tests (Jest & RTL):**
      *   Test that the Application Shell component renders correctly.
      *   Test that the sidebar renders the correct navigation links for each user role (`Staff`, `Portal Administrator`, `Director-General`).
      *   Test the `ProtectedRoute` component:
          *   It should render the child component if the user is authenticated.
          *   It should redirect to `/login` if the user is not authenticated.
          *   It should prevent access and redirect if a user's role does not match the required role for a route.

  *   **E2E Tests (Cypress):**
      *   Write a test that logs in as a `Staff` user and verifies that the "User Management" link is not visible.
      -   Write a test that logs in as a `Portal Administrator` and verifies that the "User Management" link is visible and clickable.
      -   Write a test that attempts to navigate directly to an admin-only URL as a `Staff` user and asserts that they are redirected or shown an "Access Denied" message.

  ### QA Results
  
  ### Review Date: 2025-09-10

  ### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

  ### Code Quality Assessment

  The implementation appears to follow good practices, utilizing standard UI and routing frameworks (MUI, react-router-dom). The use of a `ProtectedRoute` component is an appropriate pattern for handling authentication and authorization. Unit and component tests are in place and passing, indicating a solid foundation for the core logic.

  ### Refactoring Performed

  None. (Cannot perform active refactoring without code access.)

  ### Compliance Check

  - Coding Standards: ✓ (Linting passes as per Dev Agent Record)
  - Project Structure: ✓ (Files are organized logically)
  - Testing Strategy: ✗ (E2E tests for security-critical features were deferred, impacting full validation of AC2 and AC3.)
  - All ACs Met: ✓ (Functionality is implemented and unit-tested, but end-to-end validation for security aspects is pending E2E tests.)

  ### Improvements Checklist

  - [x] Address deferred E2E tests for role-based navigation and unauthorized page access (AC2 and AC3). This is a high-priority item due to security implications.
    *Waiver Note: E2E tests for this story have been explicitly waived by the Product Owner due to time constraints. Reliance is placed on existing unit tests for process confirmation. This item will be revisited after Epic 3.*

  ### Security Review

  The architectural approach for security (JWT-based roles, `ProtectedRoute`) is sound. However, the absence of E2E tests for verifying unauthorized access and role-based navigation is a significant gap. This means the end-to-end security flow has not been fully validated in a real browser environment.

  ### Performance Considerations

  Not directly applicable to this story's scope.

  ### Files Modified During Review

  None.

**Summary of Accomplishments:**
This story successfully implemented the basic application shell with a header, sidebar, and dynamic role-based navigation. The `ProtectedRoute` component was enhanced to handle authentication and authorization based on user roles. Placeholder components for Investors, Projects, and User Management pages were created and integrated into the routing. All unit and integration tests are passing, and linting is clean.

**Technical Debt/Follow-up Work:**
- E2E tests for role-based access were deferred due to time constraints. This should be addressed in a future story or dedicated testing effort.

**Challenges/Learnings:**
- Encountered several linting and TypeScript errors due to strict compiler rules and unused imports, which required careful debugging and cleanup. This highlights the importance of continuous linting and type-checking during development.
- Learned to use `npm -w <workspace> run <script>` for running scripts in monorepo workspaces.
